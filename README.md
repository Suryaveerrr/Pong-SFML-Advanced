-----Pong SFML – Advanced Edition-----
A modern, modular remake of the classic Pong game, developed using C++ and SFML 2.6.1. This version takes the simple foundation of Pong and builds on it with clear code structure, OOP design, customizable assets, visual polish, sound integration, and robust gameplay features.


----- Features-----
Object-Oriented Design:
Modular codebase split into classes (Ball, Paddle, Boundary, GamePlayManager, etc.) for readability, maintainability, and easy future expansion.

Custom Textures & Assets:
Supports textured paddles/ball and easy asset swapping – upgrade from plain rectangles to polished graphics!



-----Responsive Controls:-----
Smooth paddle movement, robust input handling for both players.

AI Opponent (Optional):
Enemy paddle tracks the ball automatically for a single-player challenge.

Accurate Physics:
Realistic ball-paddle collision, edge detection, and bounce mechanics.

Scoreboard & Countdown:
Dynamic on-screen scoring system, and round-start countdown for polished game flow.

Sound Integration:
Plug in your own WAV/MP3s for bounce, score, and background music for a more immersive experience.

Modern UI:
Crisp scoreboard, bold center line, and clean visual layout, easily reskinnable for custom themes.
